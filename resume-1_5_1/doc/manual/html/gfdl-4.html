    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="A"><li><p>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</p></li><li><p>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).</p></li><li><p>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.</p></li><li><p>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.</p></li><li><p>Add an appropriate
      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.</p></li><li><p>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p></li><li><p>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p></li><li><p>Include an unaltered
      copy of this License.</p></li><li><p>Preserve the section
      entitled &#8220;History&#8221;, and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled &#8220;History&#8221; in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</p></li><li><p>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the &#8220;History&#8221; section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p></li><li><p>In any section entitled
      &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221; or &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</p></li><li><p>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.</p></li><li><p>Delete any section
      entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;.  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.</p></li><li><p>Do not retitle any
      existing section as &#8220;Endorsements&#8221; or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</p></li></ol></div><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</p><p>You may add a section entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></div><div class="navheader"><table width="100%" summary="Navigation header"><tr><td align="left" width="33%"><a accesskey="p" href="gfdl-3.html"><img src="caret-l.gif" width="11" height="7" border="0" alt="Previous">COPYING IN QUANTITY</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="34%"><a accesskey="u" href="gfdl.html"><img src="caret-u.gif" width="11" height="7" border="0" alt="Up">GNU Free Documentation License</a></td><td align="right" width="33%">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="gfdl-5.html">COMBINING DOCUMENTS<img src="caret-r.gif" width="11" height="7" border="0" alt="Next"></a></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
