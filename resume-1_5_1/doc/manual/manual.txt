What is the XML Résumé Library?

   The XML Résumé Library is, at its heart, a DTD, a Document Type
   Definition. That means it is really someone's idea of how a résumé
   should, or at least could, be structured in XML. Beyond that, it comes
   with
     * Several XSLT style sheets (used to convert the XML version of a
       résumé to other formats such as plaintext, HTML, PDF, and if
       you're lucky, RTF).
     * A Java-based filter to help you target your résumé(s) toward a
       particular industry, employer, or job.
     * CSS stylesheets, used to control the presentation of the HTML
       version.
     * A helpful Makefile that you can customize for your own purposes.

   Prerequisites
   Getting the Software
   Installing and Configuring the Software

   This chapter explains how to install the XML Résumé Library, an Open
   Source, XML based résumé management system, on UNIX systems. It is
   written based on the author's experience installing on a Red Hat Linux
   system. Other systems may vary somewhat.

Prerequisites

Java

   The resources in this document provide enough information to convert
   your XML résumé to HTML, PDF, and plain text. The programs to exploit
   these resources, however, are not included. Any capable XML parser,
   XSLT stylesheet processor and XSL formatting objects processor will
   get the job done. Many of the XML Résumé Library developers use the
   free tools produced by the Apache XML Project, and we recommend that
   you do as well. These tools include Xerces, Xalan, and FOP.

   For the purposes of this document a functioning JRE (Java Runtime
   Environment) is a requirement. Obtaining and installing a JRE is
   outside the scope of this document. However, you might find Sun's J2SE
   web site a good starting point.

XML

   A minimal understanding of XML is an asset for using the XML Résumé
   Library. Most users find that they can get by following the examples
   in the absence of XML experience.

   For a more in-depth tutorial on authoring a résumé in XML, see the
   section called "Writing your first XML Résumé". For a reference on XML
   elements available in the XML Résumé Library DTD, see Element
   Reference.

Getting the Software

XML Résumé Library

   The XML Résumé Library is available for download at
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29512 and is
   linked from the main XML Résumé Library page at
   http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/.

Xerces

   Xerces is an XML parser, which is needed by the tools used in later
   steps of processing. It converts an XML document into a format that
   other computer programs can more easily use.

   The main Xerces for Java2 page is http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/,
   with the download page at http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces2-j/.

Xalan

   Xalan does the actual conversion of a résumé from XML to other
   formats. When combined with the XSL stylesheets provided by the XML
   Résumé Library, it produces directly usable HTML and plain text. It
   also produces an intermediate format called XSL-FO (XSL Formatting
   Objects) that can be converted to PDF by an FO processor.

   The Xalan-Java project page is http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/, with
   downloads at http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-j/.

FOP

   FOP is a print formatter for XSL formatting objects. It converts
   XSL-FO documents to PDF.

   The main FOP page is http://xml.apache.org/fop/, and the download page
   is http://xml.apache.org/fop/download.html.

Installing and Configuring the Software

XML Résumé Library

   The XML Résumé Library comes in a tarball (or zip archive aimed at
   Windows users) that includes:
     * The DTD
     * XSL stylesheets, for converting your XML résumé to plain text,
       HTML, or XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO). (XSL-FO can then be
       rendered to PDF by an FO processor like FOP.)
     * Some sample résumés in XML format
     * A Makefile, for generating résumé formats with a simple make
       command
     * A few CSS stylesheets that can be used to fine-tune the appearance
       of the HTML version of your résumé.

   The most straightforward way to make use of these resources is to
   recursively copy the "examples" directory to where you want to work
   with your résumé. For instance:
[resume-1_5_1]$ cp -a examples ~/resume

   The Makefile uses the filename resume.xml by default. If this is
   unacceptable you will need to edit the line resume = resume to match
   the filename you use, such as resume = myresume if your résumé is
   myresume.xml.

Tip

   You can also indicate your résumé filename on the command line when
   you build your résumé, e.g.:
[resume]$ make resume=myresume

Note

   The DTD and XSL files you've downloaded to your computer aren't used
   by default when building your résumé. Instead, the versions on the XML
   Résumé Library web site are used. This ensures that you're always
   using the most recent version; however, it also means that builds take
   longer (since file have to be downloaded each time you build your
   résumé) and that you can't build a résumé offline.

   If you'd like to use your local copy of the XSL stylesheets, edit the
   xsl_base variable in the example Makefile to point to your local XSL
   directory. For example:
xsl_base = ~/resume-1_5_1/xsl

   To use your local copy of the DTD, change the DOCTYPE declaration at
   the top of your resume to look like this:
<!DOCTYPE resume PUBLIC "-//Sean Kelly//DTD Resume 1.5.1//EN"
  "~/resume-1_5_1/dtd/resume.dtd">

Xerces, Xalan, and FOP

   Each of these three packages need to be untarred and their jar files
   copied to your JRE's ext/ directory. This is typically
   /usr/java/jdk1.3.1_02/jre/lib/ext/, but may vary depending on who
   packaged your JRE. We will simply refer to it as the ext/ directory.

   Xerces consists of the jars xmlParserAPIs.jar, xercesSamples.jar, and
   xercesImpl.jar, which are in the top directory of the Xerces zip
   archive.

   Xalan consists of the jars runtime.jar, xalanservlet.jar,
   xalansamples.jar, regexp.jar, JLex.jar, java_cup.jar, bsf.jar,
   xml-apis.jar, BCEL.jar, xsltc.jar, xalan.jar, and xercesImpl.jar in
   the bin/ directory. All of these need to be copied to the ext/
   directory.

   About this chapter

   This chapter provides an overview of the features and usage of the XML
   Résumé Library, an Open Source, XML based résumé management system, on
   UNIX systems.

Formatting an example resume

Converting to other formats

   To get a feel for the power of the XML Résumé Library you should run
   the example résumés through their paces and see how they turn out
   after processing. You can do this by renaming the file example2.xml to
   resume.xml with the command mv example2.xml resume.xml. Then simply
   issue the command gmake while connected to the internet. This should
   generate the files resume.txt, resume.html, resume.fo, and resume.pdf
   -- all versions of Alexis Kernighan's résumé.

Advanced Features of the XML Résumé Library

Filtering to target your resume

   Filtering allows you to maintain a single, complete resume.xml file
   that represents the entirety of your career/academic record, while
   allowing for the simple creation of targeted résumés. In other words,
   you can start to think of your XML Résumé as a database of your every
   skill, every accomplishment, every _____ without worrying about
   cluttering up the résumé your employer sees. Read on to find out how.

   Consider the following snippet of Jane Doe's resume:
<skillset>
            <skill>Carpentry</skill>
            <skill>Welding</skill>
            <skill>Java Programming</skill>
            <skill>XML</skill>
            <skill>C++</skill>
            <skill>Good communicator</skill>
            <skill>Gourmet Pastry Creation</skill>
            <skill>Cooking for construction workers</skill>
          </skillset>

   The problem here is that Jane needs to maintain a record of all her
   skills, but she doesn't need to tell a potential employer about all of
   those skills. Sure, Jane could selectively comment out portions of her
   résumé, but this can be tedious. Instead, she should use attributes to
   describe the categories of résumé to which a given element applies:
<skillset>
            <skill targets="construction,woodworking">Carpentry</skill>
            <skill targets="construction">Welding</skill>
            <skill targets="programming">Java Programming</skill>
            <skill targets="programming">XML</skill>
            <skill targets="programming">C++</skill>
            <skill>Good communicator</skill>
            <skill targets="foodservice">Gourmet Pastry Creation</skill>
            <skill targets="foodservice+construction">Cooking for construction
workers</skill>
          </skillset>

   After defining her targets, Jane can filter her résumé to produce
   beautifully-formatted, well-focused résumés to send to employers. Her
   "construction" résumé will contain only those elements applicable to
   the construction industry, and the job foreman won't have to read
   about her vast knowledge of meringues and bundt cakes, or her
   experience coding up an application server in Java.

   You may have noticed that some of Jane's skills apply to more than one
   target, or apply only when two (or more) targets are defined. By
   specifying a list of targets (separated by commas), Jane can ensure
   that her Carpentry skill will be included in both "construction" and
   "woodworking" résumés. Similarly, her "Cooking for construction
   workers" skill will apply only to résumés where both "foodservice" AND
   "construction" are targeted.

   Elements that have no "targets" attribute are always included in the
   filtered output. Thus Jane's communications skills will apply to every
   résumé.

   The "targets" attribute can be used in ANY element, but keep in mind
   that using targets on a high-level element (e.g., history or academics
   element) will affect all children of that element. Thus if the history
   element includes a 'targets="foo"' attribute, and "foo" is not
   included in the targets list during the filtering process, then the
   entire history section will be filtered out, even if there are
   subelements of history that do not have the 'targets="foo"' attribute.

   Now, keep in mind that defining targets is entirely up to you. You can
   use the targets attribute in any element, and you can specify any
   number of values for the target-- just keep in mind that comma (,) and
   plus (+) represent OR and AND, respectively, as per the example above.
   If the list of possible targets starts to pile up, just look at the
   end of a filtered resume.xml file: a list of the possible and selected
   targets is included for convenience.

   To get a better idea of how this all works, take a look at
   examples/example2.xml. Trying making the complete resume (with make
   all resume=example2), and then the filtered version (make filter
   resume=example2). Then compare example2.txt with
   example2-filtered.txt. To create résumés targeted to other purposes,
   change filter_targets in Makefile.

Customizing your résumé

   With just a few tweaks, you can dramatically change the look of your
   résumés.

Modifying the XSL Parameters

   The first thing to do to customize your resume is to check out the
   parameters files. The main file is xsl/params.xsl, which contains
   general parameters that you can change. We suggest making a backup of
   this file by issuing the command cp params.xsl params.xsl.dist, and
   then playing around with the values inside params.xsl to see how they
   affect the formatting and output of your resumes.

Note

   You will need to change xsl_base in Makefile to point to your local
   xsl directory before any of your changes can take effect. Otherwise,
   the default parameters stored on the XMLRésumé website are used
   instead.

   Located in the xsl/paper directory are the a4.xsl and letter.xsl
   files. These files specify things like margin size and indent size for
   their respective paper formats.

   The xsl/country directory contains country-specific parameter files,
   which contain translations for everything from "Résumé" to "Mobile
   Telephone". If you would prefer your résumé to be called a Curriculum
   Vitae, this is where to look. The files are sorted by a 2-letter
   country code (e.g., nl.xsl for the Netherlands). If you don't see your
   country there, or if there are errors/omissions in the translations,
   please attempt a translation and submit the changes back to the
   project-- while XML may work across all languages, the gentle
   developers of the XML Résumé Library Project do not.

Modifying the look of your HTML Résumé

   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a powerful way to format the look of
   your HTML Résumé. A selection of sample CSS files are provided in the
   css directory. If you have not already done so, try changing the value
   of css.href in params.xsl to a different stylesheet (you may have to
   adjust the location of the stylesheets). Once you find one you like,
   you can tweak it by editing the CSS file by hand, or create one that
   is entirely your own. If you think other people would find your CSS
   file useful, please consider submitting it back to the project.

Writing your first XML Résumé

   This is the fun part. Take a look at both example résumés and choose
   one suits you best. Then replace the existing information with your
   own. You may also be able to find example résumés of real people by
   search for XML resume on the internet.

   Library see Element Reference.

   (structure) of all of the elements that you can use to construct a
   résumé.

   To get started with creating a résumé, take a look Chapter 2, which is
   a tutorial on creating an XML résumé. Alternatively, you could examine
   the content model for the resume element, and drill down from there.

Description

   The address element defines a single postal address. It does not
   contain information about a person who resides at the address.

   Different countries have different address formatting conventions.
   Address formatting is controlled by the address.format parameter.

   If an address cannot be specified using address's child elements
   (street, city, etc.), it may be specified in untagged format. In this
   case, the address will be formatted verbatim, with line breaks
   preserved.

Parents

   address may be contained in these elements: header, referee

Attributes

   id
          A string used to uniquely identify an address. The address may
          then be referred to by this identifier.

   format
          The address format. This attribute specifies the format of an
          address, and overrides the global address.format parameter for
          each address that it appears in.

See Also

   address.format.

Examples

   Example 1. U.S.-style address
<address>
  <street>123 Pickle St.</street>
  <street>Apt. #12</street>
  <city>Sourville</city>
  <state>NX</state>
  <zip>99999-9999</zip>
</address>

   Formatted as:

   123 Pickle St. Apt. #12
   Sourville, NX 99999-9999

   Example 2. Italian address
<address>
  <street>Via Garibaldi, 23</street>
  <city>Sorrento</city>
  <postalCode>123 456</postalCode>
  <province>NA</province>
  <country>Italy</country>
</address>

   Example 3. Untagged address
<address>Reina #35, apt. 4a, e/ Gervasio y Escobar
Ciudad de La Habana, CP 11900
CUBA</address>

   Formatted as:

   Reina #35, apt. 4a, e/ Gervasio y Escobar
   Ciudad de La Habana, CP 11900
   CUBA

Warning

   You may have noticed that the XML for this address isn't indented as
   usual. This is because untagged addresses are formatted verbatim, and
   so any indentation would be preserved in the formatted address. The
   address text begins on the same line as the start tag for the same
   reason (we don't want a leading linebreak in the formatted address).

   For additional address examples, look at the XML files in the
   examples/addressing directory of the XML Résumé Library distribution.

XSL Parameter Reference
     _________________________________________________________________

   Parameters are settings that affect all files that are generated by
   the XSL templates. They are analogous to attributes that affect
   everything instead of just one element.

   This section is a partial listing of user-configurable parameters.
   There are many more tunable parameters in params.xsl. Take a look at
   the file in a text editor if you're interested.

          The title is separated from the description by a period, and
          the description paragraphs are separated from each other by
          description.para.separator.text, which defaults to an em-dash
          ("--").

          For example, the XML above would be formatted similar to the
          following:

Interests

          + Scuba diving
          + Flying. I have my pilot's license, and have logged over 1000
            in-flight hours. -- I have also constructed my own airplane
            from a kit.

   block
          Formats each of the para elements in the description as a
          separate block below the interest title.

          For example, the XML above would be formatted similar to the
          following:

Interests

          + Scuba diving
          + Flying
            I have my pilot's license, and have logged over 1000
            in-flight hours.
            I have also constructed my own airplane from a kit.

Glossary

   attribute
          Attributes provide additional information about element that
          they appear in. They take the form of name-value pairs in the
          element. The emphasized parts of this example are attributes:

<author name="a.kernighan">
<resume id="r25a4">

   element
          An element of an XML document that defines an "object", such as
          <resume> or <firstname>. HTML tags are examples of elements.
          Additionally, elements can have attributes. Elements have a
          start (or "open") tag (e.g., <firstname>) and an end (or
          "close") tag (e.g., </firstname>).

          Each element (except for the root <resume>) has exactly one
          parent element and 0 or more child elements.

   parent element
          The element whose start tags and end tags surround a given
          element.

   child element
          Any element positioned between the start tags and end tags of a
          given element.

   Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place,
     Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy
     and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
     changing it is not allowed.

PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
   the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
   this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
   credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
   modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
   works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
   can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
   such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
   addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is
   in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
   any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
   the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
   for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
   to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
   format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
   subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is
   not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
   PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
   by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
   this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
   the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
   preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.

COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
   these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
   Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
   legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover
   must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in
   addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
   preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can
   be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
   a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
   give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.

MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
       entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
       Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
       authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
       less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
       notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
       may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
       four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
       are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
       be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
   of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
   list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
   These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
   Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
   in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
   "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
   and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
   entitled "Endorsements."

COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
   of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
   other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.

AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
   of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
   with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
   are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
   of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise
   they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License provided that you also include the
   original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this
   License, the original English version will prevail.

TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.

FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
   the License in the document and put the following copyright and
   license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant
     Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
     LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the
     license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
     License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
   Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts
   being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
   free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
   permit their use in free software.
